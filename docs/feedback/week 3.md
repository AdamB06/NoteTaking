# Meeting

#### Agenda 

Quick Summary: **Good**

Feedback: Followed the template and generally had clear points. No need to have a 5min check in about how everyone is doing, but apart from small nitpicks you guys are on the right track for agendas!


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: **NA**

Feedback: *Week 2 there was no minute taker*


#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: **Good**

Feedback: All topics were covered, some miscalculation in time but generally agenda was followed quite well. Please make sure to involve everyone in the conversation, making sure that everyone except the chair speaks roughly the same amount.


#### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: **Sufficient**

Feedback: Please make sure that everyone is active and speaking during the meeting. No need to speak excessively, but we would like to see that everyone weighs in with their opinion.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Quick Summary: **Good**

Feedback: So far seems all good, we don't expect much in the first week of development so anything I see I will generally like. I am just simply not sure how much work has been done/ are you planning to do behind the scenes


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: **Insufficient**

Feedback: I have the feeling that the tasks are distributed relatively equally, but I have to say that the rounds where everyone mentions their progress it would be nice if you all mention what you are actually working on just so the TA is aware as well.
