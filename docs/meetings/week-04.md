All MRs should be merged by Sunday night.
- Feedback round : What went well and what can be improved next time? (5 min )
  - Most things went well, but we struggled a bit with submitting merge requests by Friday night because of the overlap in all of our tasks. Since this won't be as much of an issue anymore, it should be fine from this point on. Another thing that we said we could work on was being more clear regarding our tasks, which we improved by creating their respective gitLab issues and describing in further detail during the team meeting.
